One thing that I liked about this article was that the author explained what their hypothesis was, then the author provided counter arguments as to why their hypothesis was “naïve and illogical (p.63)”. I do agree that his hypothesis was reasonable because many people would think that when you verify certain cues, you would be able to predict the effects. For example, when he talks about audio-only media and how it does not transmit facial expressions. Then you would think that this would lead to not being able to read emotions clearly because you cannot tell what the person is feeling by the look on their face. But then he goes on to describe that there are many different ways to perceive emotions and non-verbal cues through different verbal messages, such as “a drawl on the final syllable, …a drop in loudness”. 

A personal example from my life that would relate to social presence and telecommunications would be interviewing over the phone, versus interviewing in person. When I was 16, my first part-time job was at Target. When you apply to Target, they first made me take a small interview over the phone before they decide if they wanted me to come in for a second in-person interview. During my first over-the-phone interview I was really nervous, I would pace back and forth in my room, thinking about the questions they would ask me. But since they couldn’t see my non-verbal cues, like shaking my hands or legs, they probably couldn’t quite tell that I was that nervous if I tried my best to speak with confidence and to not stutter or anything like that. This leads me to believe the statement in the article that says, “telephone conversation transcripts contained more verbal expressions… than did the face-to-face transcripts”. I felt as if I talked more over the phone during the interview to try to fill up any silences that came up, rather than being in person I could just sit there and look interested. I wanted to talk more on the phone to let the interviewer know that I was engaged.

One part of the article that I was a bit confused about though, is when they were measuring social presence. I kind of understood how they use the scale of impersonal to personal, and EPA, but I wasn’t too sure on how they were coming up with the numbers of degrees. For example, when they say “colourless-colorful (0.76)”, I’m not sure how they got the 0.76.

I felt that the hypothesis in the end of the article was a good way to kind of wrap everything up, when he states that the suitability of any given communication medium for a specified interaction will depend on the degree of social presence of the medium, and the degree of social presence required by the task. This makes sense because from what he talked about in the beginning, every specified type of interaction will require a certain amount of social presence. This means that certain mediums that do not support a higher amount of social presence, such as an audio-only medium, cannot be used when dealing with certain types of interactions.
