Choosing MIS was actually a surprise for me, as I only decided to Major in MIS in my final year of college. Although many aspects of computer science and security were always an interest of mine as I actually majored in ICS throughout my sophomore year. The coding aspect of ICS was interesting to me, but I personally didn't really like the discrete math part of it. That's why I chose MIS, where it was more about what the technology can do rather than all the logistics behind how it is really programmed. I also feel that taking certain ICS classes early on will help me progress through this major as I already have a feel for coding and the different languages such as java.
