<h2>Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details</h2>
<p>For this assignment, we needed to create an e-commerce website, along with a working login and user register page that enabled a user to register and create an account and have that information saved onto our servers. The user must log in before being able to purchase anything as well. Then after the user registers, they are then able to use the login page to complete their purchase and continue to the invoice page.
